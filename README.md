# credit-card-fraud-detection-ml-
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle dataset. It handles class imbalance with SMOTE and trains a Logistic Regression classifier. Performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix, and the system simulates real-time fraud detection using Python and Scikit-learn.
